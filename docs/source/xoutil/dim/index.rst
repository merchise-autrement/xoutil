.. module:: xoutil.dim

The name 'dim' is a short of dimension.  We borrow it from the topic
"dimensional analysis", even though the scope of this module is less
ambitious.

This module is divided in two major parts:

.. toctree::

   meta
   app/index


.. _concrete numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_number
