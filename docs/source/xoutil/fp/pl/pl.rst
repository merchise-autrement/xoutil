Understanding *Predicate Logic*
===============================

Predicate Logic is a set of formal systems used in philosophy, mathematics,
linguistics, and computer science.  Also known as *predicate calculus* and
*quantification theory*.

Uses propositional expressions or sentences with quantified variables over
objects.  For example, "``X`` is a programming language" it's an expression
where variable ``X`` can takes a set of possible values (i.g. "Python" or
"Haskell").

If the formal system allows predicate quantifiers or predicates can have other
predicates as arguments, then it receives the name of "Higher-order logic";
otherwise, "First-order logic".

Predicates are often associated with sets.  In higher-order theories,
predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.

A theory is usually a *predicate logic* together with a specified *domain of
discourse* over which the quantified variables are bounded.  Formal
definitions are set of sentences expressed as *predicates* defined on that
domain, *functions* from that domain to itself, and a set of *axioms* accepted
as true for those things in the domain.
