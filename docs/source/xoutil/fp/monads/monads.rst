 ``xoutil.fp.monads`` -- Yet another Python definition for Monads
==================================================================

In pure *functional programming*, a monad is used to represent computations
that requires sequenced operations, or to define arbitrary deterministic
control flows (like handling concurrency, continuations, or exceptions).

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monads_in_functional_programming

But in Python (at least for me), Monads are a way to homogenize *functional
programming* concepts with a simple syntax.  If you can find *Monads*
full-power, go to *Haskell*, or maybe to *Category Theory* in mathematics.
