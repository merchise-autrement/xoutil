- Marks the end-of-life for xoutil 1.x with Python 2 support.

  With the release of 2.0.0, xoutil ends it support for Python 2.  Releases
  1.9.x are a *continuation* of the 1.8.x series, and don't break any API
  found in the last release of that branch (1.8.8).  The change in number
  version is just to signal a milestone in the releases.  We will still keep
  1.9 for a while after the first release of xoutil 2.
