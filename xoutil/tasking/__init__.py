    (waiting included) has not reached `time`, the function will be retried.

    `wait` can be a callable or a number.  If `wait` is callable, it must take
    a single (optional) argument with the previous waiting we did (or None for
    the first retry) and return the number of seconds to wait before retrying.

    If `retry_only` is None, all exceptions (that inherits from Exception)
    will be retried.  Otherwise, only the exceptions in `retry_only` will be
    retried.

    Waiting is done with `time.sleep`:func:.  Time tracking is done with
    `time.monotonic`:func:.
