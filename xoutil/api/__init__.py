'''Support the abstraction layer intended for API definitions.

There are architectures that need to split solutions in interfaces and general
tools in low-level layers (foundation and common systems) and to adapt them in
concrete layers (industry and organization-specific).

Concrete implementations could use the same API interfaces and common tools
but disparate technologies and frameworks.

There are two base classes that allow such definitions:

- `Handler`:class:`\ : A base class -or ABC register- that allow to define
  interfaces and tools (in foundation and common layers) representing specific
  driver implementations.

- `BaseError`:class:`\ : Base to sub-class generic errors that could adopt
  different shapes in specific handler driver implementations.

Mapping mechanisms allow to fix the corresponding specific class for a general
concept of a kind defined in the API layer.

In Python there is a very nice mechanism for this kind of mapping: "Abstract
Base Classes (ABCs)".  Unfortunately it doesn't work for exceptions in some
Python versions.  Because of that, this mechanism is extended for API errors
in  internal module `xoutil.api._errors`:mod:.

class Handler(ABC):
    '''Base class for all Xoutil Handlers.

    Handlers are concepts that require an API definition in low level layers
    (protocols), and specific implementations within concrete applications.

    The following convention will be used:

    - API Interface: Any of the `Handler` sub-classes that are declared inner
      foundation and common layers (for example, `Xoutil`).

    - API Tools: All non-empty methods and module -global- functions related
      to an API Interface.

    - API Kind: Any interface defining a core concept.  Normally are direct
      `Handler`:class: sub-classes and always have sub-classes in a concrete
      execution context.

    - Driver: `Handler` sub-classes that don't have further sub-classes and
      are unique in its kind within an execution context.

    - Fixing: Localization of the implementation for the driver given the
      handler kind.  The class-method `locate_driver_class`:meth: will obtain
      the proper driver class in the current execution context.

      Applications implementing drivers must use a mechanism of "Convention
      over Configuration" (CoC) to register their classes.  The simplest one
      is to guarantee that all modules containing needed drivers are loaded
      starting each execution context.

    - A driver could define a mechanism to validate if current execution
      context is applicable to its function or not.  See
      `is_applicable_for_context`:meth:.  This will support the fixing
      process.

      If more than one driver class is applicable for a handler kind within a
      context (even when someone -myself included- could say: "WTF"), an
      additional mechanism could be applied using the
      `get_importance_for_context`:meth: method.

    - Decorator `abstractmethod` use is an obligation indicator for methods
      must be implemented in the concrete layers.

    - Drivers could implement a set of "distinguishing features of its nature"
      (traits) that must be documented by redefining the
      `list_of_traits`:meth: method.  Each trait item will be a dictionary
      compliant value using the key names 'name' and 'type' as reserved and
      mandatory; and 'desc', and 'tags' as reserved and optional.
