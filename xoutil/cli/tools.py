    '''Calculate a command name from given class.

    Names are calculated putting class names in lower case and inserting
    hyphens before each new capital letter.  For example "MyCommand" will
    generate "my-command".

    It's defined as an external function because a class method don't apply to
    minimal commands (those with only the "run" method).

    Example::

        >>> class SomeCommand(object):
        ...     pass

        >>> command_name(SomeCommand) == 'some-command'
        True

    If the command class has an attribute `command_cli_name`, this will be
    used instead::

        >>> class SomeCommand(object):
        ...    command_cli_name = 'adduser'

        >>> command_name(SomeCommand) == 'adduser'
        True

    It's an error to have a non-string `command_cli_name` attribute::

        >>> class SomeCommand(object):
        ...    command_cli_name = None

        >>> command_name(SomeCommand)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
           ...
        TypeError: Attribute 'command_cli_name' must be a string.
