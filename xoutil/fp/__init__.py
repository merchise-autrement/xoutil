'''Functional programming stuffs circa of pure definitions.

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that includes
several concepts of functional programming paradigm like comprehensions of
several types, first-class functions, higher-order function
(i.g. "decorators"), limited support for anonymous functions ("lambda"
construct), closures, generators, lazy generator expressions, some
preconceived functions (like "map", "reduce", and "filter").

This module will add some more concepts to be used in programming styles
looking to be as close as possible with "purity" (you tell what a problem is
instead of what to do to solve it).  Also, purely means that a function has no
side effects.
