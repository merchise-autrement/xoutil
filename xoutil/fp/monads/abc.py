        Use the `map` method together with the identity function (``id``) to
        extract inner value.

        This is tricky because some functors could wrap several values instead
        only one, in that case a `ValueError` will be raised.

        You can extract all values using: ``id % functor``.

        ``(<*>)`` is a beefed up ``fmap``.  It takes a functor value that has
        a function in it and another functor, and extracts that function from
        the first functor and then maps it over the second one.

        Sequentially compose two monadic actions, discarding any value
        produced by the first, like sequencing operators (such as the
        semicolon) in imperative languages.

        It is a mere convenience and commonly implemented as::

          m >> n = m >>= \_ -> n

        Applies a function ``(a -> b)`` to a value within a monad ``m``
        (converts a regular function into one that acts within ``m``), and
        that is what is meant by lifting.

        The same behaviour as ``fmap`` (`Functor.map`:meth:), but implemented
        using `bind`:meth:, and does not rely on us inheriting from
        `Functor`:class:.

        In Haskell::

          Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b

        join :: (Monad m) => m (m a) -> m a

        The join function is the conventional monad join operator. It is used
        to remove one level of monadic structure, projecting its bound
        argument into the outer level.
