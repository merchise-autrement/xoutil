'''Common Lisp "reward" features.

John McCarthy and his students began work on the first Lisp implementation in
1958.  After FORTRAN, Lisp is the oldest language still in use.

Programmers who know Lisp will tell you, there is something about this
language that sets it apart.

    Include redefinition of `__call__`:meth: to check values with special
    semantic:

    - When called as ``t(arg)``, check if `arg` is not `nil` returning a
      logical true: the same argument if `arg` is nil or a true boolean value,
      else return `t`.  That means that `False` or `0` are valid true values
      for Common Lisp but not for Python.

    - When called as ``nil(arg)``, check if `arg` is `nil` returning `t` or
      `nil` if not.

    Constructor could receive a valid name ('nil' or 't') or any other
    ``boolean`` instance.
